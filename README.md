# How to find the best vehicle available?

*It's not finished yet, it is my first project on git*

## Premises

1. I have already chosen the models that I desire, they are Honda Nmax and PCX.
2. As matter of studies, I will search in just one unique plataform.
3. The biggest challenge is to define what parameters are the most valuable for me

## Configuration

- You have to have google chrome installed in your machine
- You need to install Pyenv and Poetry

## To be Done

- Getting a better performance at scrolling down pages
- Improving link finder to just consider links of selling items
- Creating the final data exporter for getting data from accessed links

_It will be important testing it on another machine_
